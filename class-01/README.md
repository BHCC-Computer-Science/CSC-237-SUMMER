-   `build_run.sh`: Shell script to compile and run the program

### Prerequisites

-   C++ compiler (g++)
-   Terminal/Command line interface
-   Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### How to Run the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd CSC-237-SUMMER`

2. Compile the program:
   `g++ FirstApp.cpp -o output`

3. Run the executable:
